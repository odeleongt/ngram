### About the author

I have _licenciate_ degree on biochemistry and microbiology and some epidemiology training,
and work in as a research assistant at a research institute in a developing country.
The groups I work with focus on _neglected diseases_ and _emerging infectious diseases_ research
but I usually collaborate with groups that do research in other disciplines.
I like teaching and mentoring but rarely have time to take on full courses due to workload,
so I participate as guest lecturer on specific workshops (mostly on immunology or data analysis).

Since late 2012 I've been in charge of writing grant proposals for international donnors
and have been heavily involved in the design, planning and execution of the applications that got funded.

I do not have any formal education on computer science,
but have always loved computers and started self-learning from an early age.
I've been using R since my undergrad thesis
(simulations and real-world data analysis related to arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes)
on 2010.
I try to promote the use of [free software](https://fsf.org/) in research,
and serve as a data analysis advisor (mostly R use) in the institute and other departments of the university in which it is hosted.
I also have some experience on `perl`, `python` and `sql`.
