### Acknowledgments

This application draws heavily from insight provided by staff and CTAs
of the Data Science Specialization in Coursera. I want to thank particularly:

`David`:  for great advice and many entertaining and interesting discussions
          tangential to the topic at hand.

`Maciej`: for spot-on comments about R internals and issues,
          and lots of very useful code snippets.
          The text input box keeps the correct width thanks to one of these
          many examples.

There where also many peers who [very] frequently posted great content, questions and ideas.
Many comments and threads got me thinking on important issues of the tasks at hand,
most of them coming from
 `Laurent Franckx`,
 `Trevor Kelley`,
 `Juan Luis Herrera Cortijo`,
 `Karen Williams`,
 and `Lalit A. Patel`(in no particular order).
