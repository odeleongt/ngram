### Using the app

This application attempts to predict the next word given a set of initial words.
A text box is provided as input,
and the next word is predicted each time the user types a space (`" "`)
or presess the "predict" button.
The text box provides some basic autocomplete functionality
based on common English words,
which eases input and helps to get a better prediction.
