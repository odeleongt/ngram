## Executive summary

This report describes initial work performed to produce an English text prediction application.
It includes a basic description of the data used to develop the prediction algorithm,
and plans on application implementation are also described to obtain feedback from the reviewer.
Briefly, the project aims to produce an application which predicts the next word in a text input provided by the user.
It is expected that the application will have enough accuracy to fulfil user expectations,
and good response times to provide an adequate user experience.
