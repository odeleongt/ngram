## Executive summary

This report describes initial work performed to produce an English text prediction application.
It includes a basic description of the data used to develop the prediction algorithm,
and plans on application implementation are also described to obtain feedback from the reviewer.
Briefly, the project aims to produce an application which predicts the next word in a text input provided by the user.
It is expected that the application will have enough accuracy to fulfil user expectations,
and good response times to provide an adequate user experience.

## Details about the project

Text prediction of user input can be valuable to improve user experience in platforms with limited or difficult text prediction facilities,
such as mobile systems.
An application can be programmed to predict text input using techniques known as _**N**atural **L**anguage **P**rocessing_.
NLP uses large samples of actual language use to develop models
which can predict different features of the language in varying degrees of accuracy and complexity.

This project uses English language samples from digital media (blogs, news and Twitter)
in order to predict simple English text input.
The following sections describe the datasets used for the project,
highlight some interesting features and
present plans for the final model and application.
